Computer Olympiad List:

Ahmad is sending the final list of computer Olympiad qualifiers to the results review committee so that the committee can print the entry cards for the final competition. However, since no specific format was defined for registering names during the exam, participants did not write their names in a standardized way. Additionally, the language used in the competition is written after each name, and the gender of each participant is specified at the beginning of each name. The standard name format is such that the first letter of the name is capitalized, and the rest of the letters are lowercase. Write a program that reads the number of qualifiers, their names, genders, and languages from the input, separates the names based on gender, standardizes them, and writes the language used in the competition next to each name. (In the output, first print the female gender, then the male gender. Names within each gender should be printed in English alphabetical order.)
