Favorite Genres Survey:

In a survey of people interested in watching movies, participants were asked to write down their top 3 favorite genres. Six different genres were provided for them to choose from, including:
Horror, Romance, Comedy, History, Adventure, Action
Write a program that takes the number of people, then takes each person's name along with their favorite genres, and prints the name of each genre and the number of people interested in that genre, sorted by the highest interest. (If the interest in different genres is equal, sort them alphabetically in the output.) If a genre is not selected, consider its count as zero and print the genre name with the number 0 in the output.
