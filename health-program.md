# Health program:

In two schools, A and B, two different health programs have been considered. In one school, milk is distributed, while in the other school, milk is not distributed. Nutrition experts plan to collect the height, weight, and age of students from these two classes and compare them. Write a program that takes the number of students in each class along with their age, height, and weight information, stores them in a list, and calculates the average age, height, and weight of each class, printing them in separate lines in the output (printed as floats). Then, print the class with the greater average height in the output. (First, input the number and information for class A, then for class B, and print the information in the same order in the output.) If the average heights are equal, print the class with the lower average weight. If both the average height and weight are equal, print the word "Same" (exactly in this form) in the output.
The use of a class is mandatory for solving this exercise.
