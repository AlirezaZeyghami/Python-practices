# Correct email:
```text
Write a program that prints "OK" if the email entered by the user matches the following pattern, and prints "WRONG" if it does not match the pattern. (The output must be in uppercase letters.)
The pattern consists of two strings and one expression (which includes numbers and/or strings; the presence of both numbers and strings is not mandatory, and it can consist of only a string). These are separated by @ and ., and this is considered a valid email.
Pattern: expression@string.string
```
