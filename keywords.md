Write a program that extracts index words (words starting with a capital letter) from a text along with their word number (indicating their position in the text) and prints them in the output. If no word with this characteristic is found in the text, print "None" in the output. Words at the beginning of a sentence should not be considered index words. (Start counting words from 1.)
Numbers are not considered index words. The only punctuation marks used in the sentence, besides a period, are commas. Ensure that if a period or comma appears at the end of a word, it is removed.
