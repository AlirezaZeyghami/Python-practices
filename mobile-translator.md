Mobile Translator:

Nima, due to a lack of proficiency in English, is forced to attend international competitions with a translator. Since bringing another person for translation incurs high costs, Nima decides to look for an alternative solution. Now, you must help Nima by writing a translator that reads a dictionary and a sentence from the input and translates the sentence according to the specified language. During the translation process, if a word is not found in the dictionary, print the word itself in the output.
In the first line of the input, there is a number n, which represents the number of words for which translations are available in the dictionary. Each of the next n lines contains four words, where the second to fourth words are translations of the first word. Each word is translated into three different languages: the second word is the English translation, the third is the French translation, and the fourth is the German translation of the first word. The last line contains a sentence that needs to be translated from one of the languages (English, French, or German) into the language of the first word. A sentence consists of multiple words separated by spaces. (If the translation of a word consists of two parts, consider it without a space. For example, the word laprogrammation in the sample input below is written as la programmation, ignoring the space between the two parts.)
The final sentence may be a combination of words from the three languages.
