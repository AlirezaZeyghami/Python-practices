Unnamed group table:

In Group B of the World Cup, the teams Iran, Portugal, Spain, and Morocco are participating. Write a program that, given the match results, prints the name of each team, their number of wins, losses, goal difference, and points in a single line, sorted by points. If points are equal, consider the number of wins. If both points and wins are equal, sort by alphabetical order.

*Note:* A team earns 0 points for a loss, 1 point for a draw, and 3 points for a win. Goal difference is the difference between goals scored and goals conceded by a team.

The match results should be read in the following order:  
Iran – Spain  
Iran – Portugal  
Iran – Morocco  
Spain – Portugal  
Spain – Morocco  
Portugal – Morocco
