# Object-Oriented Project:

Write a program that includes a Footballer class which inherits attributes from a Human class.
The program should proceed as follows: First, create 22 Footballer objects. Then, assign the names of the players listed below to each object. Using a random method and inheritance, divide these 22 names between two teams, A and B. Finally, print each player's name along with the name of the team they are assigned to.
Player names:
Hossein - Maziar - Akbar - Nima - Mehdi - Farhad - Mohammad - Khashayar - Milad - Mostafa - Amin - Saeid - Pouya - Pourya - Reza - Ali - Behzad - Soheil - Behrouz - Shahrouz - Saman - Mohsen
